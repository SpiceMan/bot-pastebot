Schuyler patched a "nick" field into the paste form and IRC
announcement.

Rocco added a "summary" field for the paste form and IRC announcement.

TonyC added multiple features:

  An "ignore" command on the bot side to prevent it from announcing
  paste from certain addresses to certain channels.  Also a command to
  list ignored addresses.

  A "delete" command so ops can delete sensitive or offensive
  information.

  The "(none)" channel, so that pasted things aren't announced
  anywhere.

Rocco revised nopaste.text and made it into a proper TODO for the
pending SourceForge import.

Rocco created a skeleton README file.

Rocco documented the options in pastebot.conf.

Rocco applied Tony Cook's patch to prevent the bot's keep-alive timer
from triggering servers' "ping flood" detection.

Rocco applied Tony Cook's patch to allow the bot to connect via a
particular local address.  This adds the localaddr configuration
option in "irc" sections.

Rocco patched Server/Web to generate a channel listing from the
channels provided in "irc" sections.  However, he did not address the
bot's lack of proper multi-network support.

Rocco applied Tony Cook's patch to support older versions of Perl.
Use the -w flag instead of the warnings pragma.

Rocco applied Tony Cook's patch to display paste without line numbers,
making it suitable for adding to editor buffers and stuff.
