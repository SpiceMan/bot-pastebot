To do.

Requirements
------------

Perl 5.005, but Perl 5.6.1 or newer is recommended.

You'll need the following Perl modules.

  Filter::Util::Call    (comes with perl 5.8.1)
  HTTP::Request
  HTTP::Response
  HTTP::Status
  POE
  POE::Component::IRC
  Storable              (comes with perl 5.8.1)
  Text::Template
  Time::HiRes
  URI

  Perl::Tidy, which is part of perltidy, at http://perltidy.sf.net/

----------
Setting up
----------

Rename pastebot.conf-dist to pastebot.conf (unless you have one already).
Customize your new/existing pastebot.conf.
Run pastebot.perl.

Pastebot is its own web server.  It often cannot bind to port 80
because some other web server is already there.  That's why its
default port (in pastebot.conf-dist) is 8888.  This is hostile towards
people behind firewalls.

Apache users can use ProxyPass to map a directory on their port-80
servers to a running pastebot.  This feature requires Apache be built
with proxy support.

Create a virtual location for the proxy directory.

  <Location /pastebot/>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Deny from none
  </Location>

Tell Apache to forward any requests in the /pastebot/ directory
through to the local pastebot process.

  ProxyPass  /pastebot/  http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Now people can use pastebot on port 80.  Be sure to set the 'iname'
configuration flag in the pastebot.conf web_server configuration section
to hide the internal host/port values.

Be sure to set the "iname" option to point to your Apache server
rather than the pastebot server directly.

------
Errors
------

* IRC client (foo): socket error occurred: Can't assign requested address

  The most likely cause of this is an unknown host name, either for a
  local machine or a remote IRC server.  If you have multiple servers
  specified, the bot will try the next server in approximately one
  minute.

* Can't locate [some module] in @INC (@INC contains: ...)

  Somehow you managed to install one of pastebot's required modules
  without installing a module it in turn needs.  You'll need to install
  [some module] manually.

Various support options are available from pastebot's SourceForge
summary page.  Please see: http://sf.net/projects/pastebot/
